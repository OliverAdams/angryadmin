# Creating a Log Analytics Workspace - LAW

There is plenty of official documentation on how to create a log analytics workspace
so instead of taking you through that step by step I will go through some important points when creating a workspace

## Resource Groups
  Separate resource groups for each log analytics workspace
  resource group naming convention
  
## Pricing

## Workspace Location
  The same region as what you are wanting to analyse
  How to find your tenant location?

## Different log types
  Some logs are free to ingest and some logs are not?
  Cheaper retention without log analytics, when you ingest your logs copy them to blob storage at the same time to make retention cheaper.</br>
  All client log files are free to ingest. however if they are placed into a LAW with server or application log files </br>
  you will pay for your client logs also.</br>
  Keep your client logs separate unless you are using sentinel.</br>
  What other logs are free. -hyperlink </br>

## Sentintel
  Sentinel can only connect to a single low analytics workspace
  Sentinel increases retention from 30 to 90 days
