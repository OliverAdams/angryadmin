## Welcome to The Angry Admin

After years of reading other peoples blog posts I finally decided to try and create my own.

Welcome to my world of automation inside the artic circle.

For my first post I have decided to write a full length article about how to create an Azure Dashboard showing the health of your teams meeting room devices.

This requires knowledge of several different areas including 
                  - Windows Event Log
                  - Azure log analytics
                  - Azure Workbooks and Dashboards
                  - Kusto Query Language (KQL)
